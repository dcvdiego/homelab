Trying to get obsidian to work not only by syncing the notes themselves, but also have some integration with git and configuration as well. Meaning I can write the documentation for my homelab using it.

Obsidian will be installed with both LiveSync and Git, Vim motions are also available and will be used.

I will be testing a push now, after having to enable personal access tokens to be able to push using my work laptop CLI rather than GitHub desktop.
